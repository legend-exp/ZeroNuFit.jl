Here we collected a series of example scripts that might be useful to retrieve output information in form of:
- text printed on terminal
- pdfs where we compared marginalized posterior distributions, nuisance parameters inputs versus values extracted from the fit, sensitivty results, etc.

> [!!!NOTE]
> These scripts are intended as a starting point for more advanced analyses. Some of these are pretty hardcoded and related to the type of fits you previously ran.
